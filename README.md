# Angio
This repository contains two interactive web applications for simulating angiogenesis in 3D, visualized using Plotly.Filesindex2.html: A general 3D Angiogenesis Simulation with configurable tissue types and advanced biophysical parameters.cancer.html: A 3D Tumor Angiogenesis Simulation specifically focusing on tumor growth and its influence on vascularization, with options to visualize oxygen levels.Featuresindex2.html (General Angiogenesis Simulation)This simulation models the growth of a vascular network within a 3D tissue environment, taking into account various biophysical factors.Configurable Tissue Types: Select from different tissue types (Liver, Bone, Muscle, Kidney, Skin) to observe how tissue-specific properties influence angiogenesis.Vascular Tree Generation: Simulates the branching of arteries, arterioles, capillaries, venules, and veins.Growth Factor Dynamics: Incorporates the diffusion and decay of growth factors (VEGF and anti-angiogenic factors) influencing vessel growth.Tissue Stiffness: Models the impact of tissue stiffness on vessel branching and direction.Oxygen Diffusion: Calculates and visualizes oxygen levels within the tissue, showing how well cells are supplied by the vascular network.Notch-Delta Signaling: Implements a simplified Notch-Delta signaling pathway, a crucial mechanism in regulating vessel sprouting.Interactive Parameters: Adjust sliders for:Max Depth of main vesselsAngle Range for branchingBranch LengthCapillary ThresholdOxygen Scale (diffusion)Number of initial Arteries and Veins3D Visualization: Uses Plotly.js for interactive 3D rendering of the vascular network and cell populations, with color-coding for vessel types and oxygen levels.cancer.html (Tumor Angiogenesis Simulation)This simulation extends the angiogenesis model to specifically explore the interaction between tumor growth and the development of new blood vessels.Tumor Cell Integration: Includes both healthy and tumor cells, with tumor cells acting as strong angiogenic signal sources.Tumor-Induced Angiogenesis: Vessels are attracted to tumor cells, and vessel growth in proximity to tumors exhibits increased tortuosity.Oxygen Mapping: Toggle between visualizing the vasculature/cell types and an oxygen supply map, showing oxygen distribution across the tissue based on vessel proximity.Interactive Parameters: Adjust sliders for:Max Depth of main vesselsAngle Range for branchingBranch LengthCapillary ThresholdNumber of Cells (total)Tumor Proportion (percentage of tumor cells)Tumor Attraction Factor (how strongly tumors attract vessels)Tumor Tortuosity Factor (how curvy vessels become near tumors)Oxygen Scale (diffusion)Number of initial Arteries and Veins3D Visualization: Utilizes Plotly.js for interactive 3D rendering of the vascular network and cells, with specific colors for healthy and tumor cells.Technologies UsedHTML5: Structure of the web pages.CSS3: Styling and responsive layout.JavaScript: Core simulation logic and UI interaction.Plotly.js: For interactive 3D data visualization.Numeric.js: Used for numerical operations, specifically in the GrowthFactorField and StiffnessField in index2.html.How to UseDownload the files: Save index2.html and cancer.html to your local machine.Open in Browser: Simply open either index2.html or cancer.html in a modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).Interact: Use the sliders and buttons on the right-hand panel to adjust simulation parameters and observe the changes in the 3D visualization.For cancer.html, use the "Show Oxygen Map" button to toggle between visualizing vessel types/cell types and the oxygen distribution.Development NotesBoth simulations are self-contained within single HTML files, including all JavaScript and CSS. They are designed to be responsive, adapting to different screen sizes.The angiogenesis models are simplified representations of complex biological processes and serve as educational or exploratory tools.
